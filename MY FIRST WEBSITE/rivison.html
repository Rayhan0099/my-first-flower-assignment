<p>Html menings Hyper tex markup language</p>
<p>The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.

    <b>Web browsers</b> receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into <em>multimedia web pages.</em> HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for its appearance.</p>
